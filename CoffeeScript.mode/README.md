CoffeeScript.mode
================
Syntax highlighting for CoffeeScript in Coda 2.

This mode was originally developed by Sean Durham (https://github.com/nfiniteset/CoffeeScript.mode).
Many thanks to him and all of the contributors.
I've made changes to most of the code and decided to break off into a new direction with support
for Coda 2.
 
Installation
------------
1. `cd ~/Library/Application\ Support/Coda\ 2/Modes`
2. `git clone git@github.com:caseywebdev/CoffeeScript.mode`
3. (Re)Start Coda 2
